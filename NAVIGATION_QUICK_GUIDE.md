## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why did "Dashboard" become "Overview Dashboard"?
**A**: To distinguish it from "Officer Dashboard" (now "My Work"). "Overview Dashboard" clearly indicates it shows a system-wide overview.

### Q: Why is it called "My Work" now?
**A**: Because that's what it actually is - your personal workspace with your assigned tasks and cases. Much clearer than "Officer Dashboard".

### Q: Where did "Forest Atlas" go?
**A**: It's now called "Interactive Map" - same feature, clearer name that describes what it actually does.

### Q: Why are there badges next to some items?
**A**: Badges show who can use that feature:
- **[Officer]** = for field officers
- **[Admin Only]** = only for administrators

### Q: Can I still collapse the sidebar?
**A**: Yes! Click the menu icon to collapse. You'll see just the icons, and hovering shows the full name.

### Q: Why do I see fewer items than before?
**A**: The menu is role-based. You only see features relevant to your role. Nothing was removed - you just see what you need.
